gstreamer-examples
==================

This example project serves as a demonstration on how to stream video and 
audio from one device to another.

Examples here can be used to build other more complicated program.

Background
==========

`gstreamer` has always been shrouded in mystery. It's been including in Linux
platforms for a very long time. And there's been some press about it. So
what is it all about?

Turns out, you can stream video and audio with it. The software uses it's own
language, almost, to describe a graph of the way the encoder and decoders are
connected.

Best Example
============

See `gst-net-server.sh` and `gst-net-client.sh` for a two-port streaming
solution.
